00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
In a city where justice should be a birthright,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.760
Atlanta faces a struggle against systemic 
injustice in policing and mass incarceration.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.560
Atlanta DSA stands as a beacon of hope, 
dedicated to dismantling oppressive

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.680
structures that perpetuate police 
brutality and mass incarceration.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.640
Their mission is resolute: to advocate for 
transformative changes in law enforcement

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.040
policies and to challenge the mass incarceration

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.440
system that disproportionately 
impacts marginalized communities.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.760
Join Atlanta DSA for their upcoming 
events, where they will be hosting

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.160
panel discussions featuring activists, 
legal experts, and community leaders,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.840
aiming to drive tangible solutions to combat 
police violence and incarceration disparities.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.360
Your voice matters. Your actions count. 
Together, we can demand accountability,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.640
fairness, and equity within our law 
enforcement and justice systems.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
