00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.520
Historical factors have trickled into an 
ever present plague of systematic oppression.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.760
Two forms of this systematic oppression 
are the injustices of mass incarceration

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.353
and police brutality.

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:34.423
These tragedies are especially  
prevalent among marginalized communities.

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:40.272
Even as society begins to acknowledge such disparities,

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:47.880
the systematic oppressions continue 
by policing the truth and concealing details or

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.439
evidence that could be beneficial to victims.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:01:00.217
As this exhibit paints a picture of
what these overwhelming tragedies entail,

00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:07.333
we invite you into a final yet integral stepping stone.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.841
First let me ask.

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:19.282
How does one move forward in not only acknowledging
but also understanding the depth of these injustices?

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:24.929
Then, how do they act on what they know?

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:35.938
With that, we present the other side of living in 
our tragedies which is to walk in the hope for our future.

00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:43.510
In fact, we invite you to journey with us
as we highlight local Atlanta events, organizations,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:54.376
and activists who are impressively
making things better for tomorrow.

00:01:54.376 --> 00:02:04.000
It is our hope that this is an experience that
moves you to tap into the feelings that were evoked by this exhibit

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.305
and step into greater Atlanta with
fresh perspective and drive.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:18.306
We challenge you to go beyond these four walls
and be that agent of change,

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:29.760
that catalyst for justice, 
and ultimately the hope for the future.
