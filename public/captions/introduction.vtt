00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.520
Historical factors have trickled into an 
ever present plague of systematic oppression.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.760
Two forms of this systematic oppression 
are the injustices of mass incarceration

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.200
and police brutality.
These tragedies are especially

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.800
prevalent among marginalized communities.
Even as society begins to acknowledge such

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.880
disparities, the systematic oppressions continue 
by policing the truth and concealing details or

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:57.160
evidence that could be beneficial to victims.
As this exhibit paints a picture of what these

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:07.280
overwhelming tragedies entail, we invite you 
into a final yet integral stepping stone.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.920
First let me ask. How does one move forward in 
not only acknowledging but also understanding

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.600
the depth of these injustices? Then, 
how do they act on what they know

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.080
With that we present the other side of living in 
our tragedies which is to walk in the hope for

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:45.120
our future. In fact, we invite you to journey 
with us as we highlight local Atlanta events,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.280
organizations, and activists who are 
impressively making things better for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.000
tomorrow. It is our hope that this is an 
experience that moves you to tap into the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.440
feelings that were evoked by this exhibit 
and step into greater Atlanta with fresh

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:16.640
perspective and drive. We challenge you 
to go beyond these four walls and be that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:29.760
agent of change, catalyst for justice, 
and ultimately the hope for the future.
