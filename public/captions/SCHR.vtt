00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.630
Equality, dignity, and justice for people
impacted by the criminal legal system are

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.380
among the core values of Southern Center for
Human Rights.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.580
The organization actively upholds these principles
through its unwavering commitment

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.099
to shaping a world free from mass incarceration, the
death penalty, the criminalization of poverty,

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.740
and racial injustice.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.180
SCHR’s continued dedication is in hopes
of the legal system not being used as a tool

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:50.170
to concentrate power and control, but as an
instrument of true justice by which individuals

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.140
and communities remain accountable to each
other.Considering more than 525,000 people

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.559
are either incarcerated, on probation, or
on parole in Georgia, Georgia has the highest

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.070
rate of correctional supervision in the country.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:10.409
As SCHR acknowledges these truths SCHR’s
addressment of mass incarceration is the role

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.020
as a support system in the journey after reentry.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.329
With that, we invitie you to take further
action in the fight against mass incarceration

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:34.520
by attending SCHR’s upcoming event The Movement
to End Mass Incarceration: The Importance

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.479
of Centering the Voices, Experience & Leadership
of Formerly Incarcerated People

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:56.540
Ultimately, SCHR invites you to join them
in a fight for a world free from mass incarceration,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.260
the death penalty,
the criminalization of poverty, and racial injustice.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.030
Your participation is crucial in shaping
a more just and equitable society.
