00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.540
Equality, dignity, and justice for individuals 
affected by the criminal legal system

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.662
stand as core values for the
Southern Center for Human Rights (SCHR).

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:19.046
The organization actively upholds these principles
through its unwavering commitment

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:25.576
to shaping a world free of mass incarceration,
the death penalty, the criminalization of poverty,

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:28.745
and racial injustice.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:35.756
The Southern Center for Human Rights's persistent dedication
aims to prevent the legal system

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:40.177
from becoming a tool for concentrating power and control.

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:47.426
Instead, the organization envisions the legal system 
becoming an instrument of true justice,

00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:52.225
fostering accountability between individuals and communities.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:59.240
Given that Georgia currently has the highest 
rate of correctional supervision in the country,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.598
The Southern Center for Human Rights
acknowledges these alarming realities

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:09.359
and in response, this organization
addresses mass incarceration

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.599
by serving as a vital support system
in the journey after reentry.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.947
In light of these challenges,
we extend an invitation to you

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:24.484
to take meaningful action
in the fight against mass incarceration.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:29.503
Join us at the Southern Center for Human Rights's upcoming event,

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:40.200
"The Movement to End Mass Incarceration: The Importance of Centering the Voices, Experience & Leadership of Formerly Incarcerated People."

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200
via Zoom on December 14 at 3 PM

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.680
As we collectively confront these issues, SCHR 
encourages you to stand with us in advocating for

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.955
a world free from mass incarceration, the death 
penalty, the criminalization of poverty

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:01.894
and racial injustice.

00:02:01.894 --> 00:02:13.956
Your participation is crucial 
in shaping a more just and equitable society.
