In the heart of 
Atlanta, a movement is growing.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.384
It's called 'Stop Cop City,' a 
grassroots coalition united for a common cause.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.880
Their mission? To challenge 
the proposed construction of a massive

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.258
police training facility in 
Atlanta's forested areas.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.800
This group believes in 
protecting our green spaces and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.475
questions the impact of such developments 
on communities and the environment.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.520
Through education, advocacy,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.532
and non-violent protest, 'Stop Cop 
City' is making their voice heard.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.560
Join the conversation. 
Help shape the future of Atlanta.
