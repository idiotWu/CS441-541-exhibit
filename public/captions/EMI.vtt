Their mission is crystal clear: to dismantle the 
systemic injustices within law enforcement and

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.600
the incarceration system, striving for a Georgia 
where justice is equitable and accessible for all.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.240
They actively work to challenge biased 
policing practices and the cycle of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.840
incarceration that disproportionately 
impacts marginalized communities.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.120
Join them for upcoming events, where they will 
be organizing rallies for police accountability,

hosting workshops on understanding 
systemic racism in the justice system,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.800
and launching awareness campaigns 
to promote community involvement.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.320
Your voice matters. Your 
participation counts. Together,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.520
we can demand justice and reshape 
the future of our communities.
